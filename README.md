This Wordle app, developed by Duke Tran and Andrea Arrivillaga, is built using React and incorporates Neural Networks and Naive Bayes algorithms to suggest the next word for the user to select. Additionally, it features a simulation component, allowing users to test the machine learning model directly within the React application.
